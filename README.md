# VS-and-OpenGL-SetUp
Visual Studio Code and OpenGL set up for SNHU CS330

For use with Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU) CS330: Computer Graphics and Visualization

Project to help set up OpenGL with FreeGLUT, GLEW, GLM, and SOIL2.
The powerpoint was created to help visual see the steps needed.
There is an included OpenGL.zip file for use with all dependancies needed.

This worked on a Windows 10 on Visual Studio 2017.
It is unknown if this will work on all other systems, but if it does please let us know.
If you find an issue please open a ticket for us to correct.

Thank you,

Brandon and Eddie
